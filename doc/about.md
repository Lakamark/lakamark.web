# About The Project “Lakamark.web”

The main purpose of this project is to create my dream website. Where I can share my creation with the community. I want my website to be a central platform for my artist’s life. Where you can participate many times, even with me. Okay, but it’s an ambitious project! You have some questions to ask me. That's why I created this doc about the project.

## Disclaimer!

The arguments are subjective. Meaning, the arguments were based on my developer experiences. It is normal if you do not agree with my opinion. For instance, the technology you use a lot for your projects is great, but for me, it was not great. Please be respectful. I am not a professional developer. It is my personal hobby. If you want to participate in the project and to give me some tips to improve my workflow, you are welcome!

## Is it necessary to have a website today?

It is a good question. Now we have a social platform (Instagram, TikTok, DeviantArt, etc.) to share my artwork with my community. You are right. I think the problem is I do not have a central platform to share my last activities or my last creation with the community. I am working on many projects for customers. I would like to have a professional portfolio to watch customers. I think the website is an easier way to share my latest activities with my community.

## Why do you not use a WorldPress for your portfolio?
Don’t worry, I thought about using a simple WorldPress and to customize and voilà! I know my first website was on WorldPress many years ago. When I started to learn PHP progradation, my needs were too specific to use a simple WorldPress. I would like some flexibility to add some features and to change the infrastructure project according to my needs. It is my personal choice to use another technology to create my website.

## Why did you choose the Symfony framework to create your website?
I like the framework. During my experimentation, I tried Laravel, CakePHP and Symfony.

1. **CakePHP:** My second website was created on CakePHP in version 2.0! I did my first skills in this framework. I discovered the Model View Controller system (MVC). When version 3x was released, a lot of fixtures were broken. My website was not compatible with the 3x version.
2. **Laravel:** It is easier to create an application. The documentation is great. With Laravel, you have a good tool already ready to implement your application. (Account system, crud system) I like to analyze what is doing being a function, a class or an object. Laravel uses a lot of “Facades” and having a code is easier to read. They use a lot of magic methods to initialize the objects in your application. It was harder for me to have control of the objects. Each time I make an update to the Laravel framework, there are a lot of breaking changes. Often I read the log on the documentation and to fix my code.
3. **Symfony:** After experimental Laravel, I am looking for another PHP framework. I discovered the Symfony 
   framework via the Grafikart website. [He created a good Symfony tutorial on Symfony](https://grafikart.
   fr/formations/apprendre-symfony-7). The framework is easier to change the structure without manually all objects. 
   They are a powerful dependency container and services registry. When they release a new version, the Symfony team 
   does not change a lot of features. Sometimes, they are depreciated features he gives a tip to use the equivalent 
   of using. The framework uses the YML configurations. You should be explicit about loading your object in your 
   controller, Repository, etc. You have some difficulty reading the code, there are a lot of PHP attributes, a lot 
   of parameters, etc. I have a better control on the object behavior.  

## Conclusion
Finally, I choose the Symfony framework to build my own website respect my specific needs.
